            	<p>The font face stack is "Roboto", "Helvetica Neue", Arial, Sans-serif</p>
            	<p>The base font size for the website is left at 100% (which is 16px by default in most browsers).</p>
				<p>All font-sizes are calculated as REMs, with a pixel fallback value.</p>
				<p>The basic set of styles are based on a typographic scale of 11, 14, 16, 18, 24, and 32.</p>
				<p>All components align to an 8 pixel square baseline grid and type aligns to a 4px grid, within reason.</p>

				<h2>Paragraphs &amp; inline styles</h2>

				<p>This is a normal paragraph (<code>p</code> element). To add some length to it, let us mention that this page was primarily written for testing the effect of <strong>user style sheets</strong>. You can use it for <a href="#">various other purposes as well</a>, like just checking how your browser displays various HTML elements by default. It can also be useful when testing conversions from HTML format to other formats, since some elements can go wrong then.</p>

				<p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>

				<p>This is a paragraph. Paragraphs are preset with a font size, <a href="#">line height and spacing</a> to match the overall vertical rhythm. To show what a paragraph looks like this needs a little more content so, did you know that there are storms occurring on Jupiter that are larger than the Earth? Pretty cool.</p>
                <p><abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> (abbreviation - <code>abbr</code> markup used)</p>

                <p><b>bolded</b> (<code>b</code> markup used - just bolding with unspecified semantics)</p>
                <p><cite>Origin of Species</cite> (a book title; <code>cite</code> markup used)</p>
                <p><code>a[i] = b[i] + c[i);</code> (computer code; <code>code</code> markup used)</p>
                <p>Here we have some <del>deleted</del> text. (<code>del</code> markup used)</p>
                <p>An <dfn>octet</dfn> is an entity consisting of eight bits (<code>dfn</code> markup used for the term being defined)</p>
                <p>This is <em>very</em> simple (<code>em</code> markup used to emphasise a word)</p>
                <p><i lang="la">Homo sapiens</i> (<code>i</code> markup used - just italics with no unspecified semantics)</p>

                <p>Type <kbd>yes</kbd> when prompted for an answer (<code>kbd</code> markup used for text indicating keyboard input)</p>
                <p>Some of the elements tested above are typically displayed in a monospace font, often using the same presentation for all of them. This tests whether that is the case on your browser:</p>

				<ul>
				  <li><code>This is sample text inside code markup</code></li>
				  <li><kbd>This is sample text inside kbd markup</kbd></li>
				  <li><samp>This is sample text inside samp markup</samp></li>
				</ul>

				<h2>Lists</h2>

				<p>This is a paragraph before an <strong>unordered</strong> list. Note that the spacing between a paragraph and a list before or after that is hard to tune in a style sheet. You can't guess which paragraphs are logically related to a list, e.g. as a "list header".</p>
				<ul>
				  <li>One</li>
				  <li><a href="#">Two</a></li>
				  <li>List item
					<ul>
					  <li>Nested List Item</li>
					  <li>Nested List Item</li>
					  <li><a href="#">Link</a></li>
					  <li>Nested List Item</li>
					</ul>
				  </li>
				  <li>Three. Well, probably this list item should be longer. Note that for short items lists look better if they are compactly presented, whereas for long items, it would be better to have more vertical spacing between items.</li>
				  <li>Four. This is the last item in this list. Let us terminate the list now without making any more fuss about it.</li>
				</ul>

				<p>Daniel goes back and sits by one of the windows – these are undershot so that he can look straight down and see Minerva’s wake being born in a foamy collision around the rudder. He opens a small hatch below a window and drops out a Fahrenheit thermometer on a string. It is the very latest in temperature measurement from Europe – Enoch presented it to him as a sort of party favour. He lets it bounce through the surf for a few minutes, then hauls it in a takes a reading.</p>

				<p>He’s been trying to perform this ritual every four hours – the objective being to see if there’s any rumour that the North Atlantic is striped with currents of warm water. He can present the data to the Royal Society if God-willing he reaches London.</p>
